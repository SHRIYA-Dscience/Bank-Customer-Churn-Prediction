# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project fetches the customers whose want to services of Bank. In this project, I used logistic algorithm which is based on classification approach where we deal with 1's and 0's. here my target variable is churn if churn value is 1 that means customer want their facility and 0's means the customer don't want facility.
